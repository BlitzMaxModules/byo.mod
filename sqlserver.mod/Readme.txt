SQL Server module for Blitzmax
-----------------------------
This module is offered "AS IS" meaning I'm not responsable for anything that happens to you while using it. Please do not distribute the DLL separatedly.

Windows OS only.

You can use it in any way you want it, even commercially provided you don't distribute the DLL as a single product. The DLL file can and should be distributed with your application though. No royalties required. Feel free to contact me on the Blitzbasic forums or by mail:
